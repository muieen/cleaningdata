A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

raw data:
Testing = labels for testing
Training = labels for training
SubjTrain = subject for training
SubjTest = subject for testing
FeaTest = sets of Testing data
FeaTrain = sets of Training data
Features = List of all features
Actlab = List all class labels and activity names to match labels and activities

merged files:
TesTrain = label data for both testing and training
Subj= subject data for both testing and training
Feating = Final data table

Calculations:
FeatMeanSD = Standard Deviations for all features

transformations:
renamed a number of different column headers 
added standard deviation and mean columns
merged numerous data tables together through rbind and cbind

renamed variables
