# cleaningdata

From course website: 
"The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.  You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

UCI HAR Dataset = files given to us by instructor
runanalysis.r = code made to do what was necessary for project
cleanData.txt = tidy data representation 
codebook.md = codebook describing the variables, the data and any transformations or wok that were performed to clean up the data.
